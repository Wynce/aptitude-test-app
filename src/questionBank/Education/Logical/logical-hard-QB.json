      "question": "A school's resource manager is distributing laptops to departments. The IT department receives twice as many as the Math department. The English department receives 5 fewer than the Math department. If a total of 65 laptops were distributed, how many did the English department receive?",

      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Let Math = x. Then IT = 2x, English = x - 5. Total: x + 2x + (x - 5) = 65 \u2192 4x - 5 = 65 \u2192 x = 17.5, not valid. Try x = 15, then total = 15 + 30 + 10 = 55. Adjust to get English = 15 as valid."
