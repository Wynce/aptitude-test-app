    "question": "A student must attend two workshops in a day. Workshop A lasts 2.5 hours, Workshop B lasts 1.5 hours, and Workshop C lasts 2 hours. The student only has less than 4 hours available. Which combination of workshops can they attend fully within the time limit?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A and B",
      "B": "A and C",
      "C": "B and C",
      "D": "None"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "B + C = 1.5 + 2 = 3.5 hours, which fits within the 4-hour limit. A + B = 4h, possible but not less than 4. A + C = 4.5h, exceeds limit."

    "question": "A principal needs to form 5 committees with 4 teachers each, from a pool of 20 teachers. Each teacher can only be in one committee. How many different ways can these committees be formed?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Too complex to count without permutation formula",
      "B": "More than 1 million",
      "C": "Exactly 1 way since all must join",
      "D": "Depends on committee labels (labeled vs. unlabeled)"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "If committees are labeled (Committee A, B...), then permutations count. If unlabeled, combinations apply. So the number depends on structure."
